This nodes was designed to help AI image creators to generate prompts for human portraits.

## New major version!

- The node has been divided into three separate modules: **Base Character**, **Skin Details**, **Style & Pose**.
- Eliminated randomization switches: selectors now have the built-in selectable option.
- Improved code and performance.

Parameters with null value (-) would be not included in the prompt generated.

To enable the casual generation options, connect a random seed generator to the nodes.

The nodes generates output string.

## Model Pose Library

The _model_pose_ option allows you to use a list of default poses. You need to disable ControlNet, if in use,  in this case and adjust framing with the _shot_ option.

## Practical advice

Using high values for the skin and eye detail control parameters may override the setting for the chosen shot. In this case it is advisable to reduce the parameter values for the skin and eyes, or insert in the negative prompt (closeup, close up, close-up:1.5), modifying the weight as needed.

## Notes

The effectiveness of the parameters depends on the quality of the checkpoint used.

For advanced photorealism we recommend [FormulaXL 2.0](https://civitai.com/models/129922?modelVersionId=160525).

Portrait Master is compatible with [Prompt Composer](https://github.com/florestefano1975/comfyui-prompt-composer/).
